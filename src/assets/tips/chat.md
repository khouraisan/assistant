# Chat History

The chat history section provides a detailed overview of all previous conversations. Each chat is stored chronologically, allowing users to easily navigate through past interactions. This feature is particularly useful for referencing earlier discussions, retrieving shared information, or simply revisiting memorable exchanges. The chat history is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that users can quickly locate the information they need without unnecessary complexity.

Chats are categorized based on their type, such as personal, group, or temporary chats. Users can filter their history to focus on specific categories or search for keywords within the conversations. This level of organization ensures that even the most extensive chat histories remain manageable and accessible.

Additionally, the chat history includes timestamps for each message, providing context for when the conversation took place. Users can also view metadata, such as the participants involved and any attachments shared during the chat. This comprehensive approach to chat history management ensures that users have all the tools they need to stay organized and informed.

# Chat Notifications

Notifications play a crucial role in keeping users updated on new messages and activities within their chats. The notification system is designed to be both efficient and non-intrusive, ensuring that users are alerted to important updates without being overwhelmed by constant interruptions. Notifications can be customized based on user preferences, allowing for a tailored experience that suits individual needs.

For example, users can choose to receive notifications for specific chats or mute notifications for less critical conversations. This flexibility ensures that users remain in control of their communication experience. Notifications can also include previews of new messages, enabling users to quickly assess the importance of a message without needing to open the chat.

In addition to message alerts, the notification system can inform users of other events, such as new participants joining a group chat or changes to chat settings. This comprehensive approach to notifications ensures that users are always informed and engaged with their chats.
